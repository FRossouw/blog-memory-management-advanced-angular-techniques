## Blog Information
Memory Management plays a crucial role in developing efficient and high-performance Angular Applications. Angular applications are becoming increasingly more complex and feature-rich, and managing memory effectively is becoming increasingly important. Unused memory can lead to memory leaks if not properly released; thus, a decrease in performance, as well as an increase in resource usage, and, worst case, even application crashes can be noted.

Essentially it is crucial to understand the basics and implementation of advanced memory management techniques, to build robust and optimized Angular applications that range from small to enterprise scales.

This article aims to delve into the various memory leaks and aims to demonstrate various advanced techniques in easy-to-understand terms that will assist any developer when they are trying to overcome memory leaks. The techniques that are being demonstrated will also assist in the prevention as well as the optimization of memory used within any Angular application.

Some techniques that are demonstrated are the following: async pipes, leveraging the ngOnDestroyAngular lifecycle hook, the Renderer2service, as well as implementing various custom memory management strategies.

Not all techniques have to be as advanced; Performance Profiling and Code Optimization will also be discussed; which can essentially be just as important as well as assist in the identification and resolution of memory-related issues.

By implementing these advanced techniques, any Angular application can are running efficiently, with optimized memory usage, and provide a higher-standard user experience.

## Starting the Application
1. Clone the project from GitHUb into a folder on your computer.
2. Run `npm install` in the terminal to install all dependencies.
3. Run `ng serve` for a local development server.
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see the application running.
